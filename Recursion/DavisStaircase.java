/**
 * Davis has a number of staircases in his house and he likes to climb each staircase 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. Being a very precocious child, he wonders how many ways 
 * there are to reach the top of the staircase.
 * 
 * Given the respective heights for each of the s staircases in his house, find and print the number of ways he can climb each staircase, module 10^10 + 7 on a new line.
 * 
 * For example, there is s=1 staircase in the house that is n=5 steps high. Davis can step on the following sequences of steps:
 * 
 * 1 1 1 1 1
 * 1 1 1 2
 * 1 1 2 1 
 * 1 2 1 1
 * 2 1 1 1
 * 1 2 2
 * 2 2 1
 * 2 1 2
 * 1 1 3
 * 1 3 1
 * 3 1 1
 * 2 3
 * 3 2
 * 
 * There are 13 possible ways he can take these 5 steps. 13%10000000007 = 13
 * 
 * Function Description
 * 
 * Complete the stepPerms function in the editor below. It should recursively calculate and return the integer number of ways Davis can climb the staircase, modulo 
 * 10000000007.
 * 
 * stepPerms has the following parameter(s):
 * - n: an integer, the number of stairs in the staircase
 * 
 * Input Format
 * 
 * The first line contains a single integer, s, the number of staircases in his house.
 * Each of the following s lines contains a single integer, n, the height of staircase i.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * 1 <= s <=5
 * 1 <= n <= 36
 * 
 * Subtasks
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 20 for 50% of the maximum score.
 * 
 * Output Format
 * 
 * For each staircase, return the number of ways Davis can climb it as an integer.
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 
 * 3
 * 1
 * 3
 * 7
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * 
 * 1
 * 4
 * 44
 * 
 * Explanation
 * 
 * Let's calculate the number of ways of climbing the first two of the Davis' s=3 staircases:
 * 
 * 1. The first staircase only has n=1 step, so there is only one way for him to climb it (i.e., by jumping 1 step). Thus, we print 1 on a new line.
 * 2. The second staircase has n=3 steps and he can climb it in any of the four following ways:
 * 		1. 1->1->1
 *      2. 1->2
 *      3. 2->1
 *      4. 3
 * 
 * Thus, we print 4 on a new line.
